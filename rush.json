   * of projects.  In practice, you will find that the folder hierarchy needs to be rebalanced
   * occasionally, but if that's painful, it's a warning sign that your development style may
   * discourage refactoring.  Reorganizing the categories should be an enlightening discussion
   * that brings people together, and maybe also identifies poor coding practices (e.g. file
   * references that reach into other project's folders without using Node.js module resolution).
