# Markdown Example

This is a markdown (`.md` or `.mdx`) file that is being transformed with [`gatsby-mdx`](https://gatsby-mdx.netlify.com/).

What's cool about it is you can mix markdown with React components:

<p>
  <Button color="text" onClick={() => alert('You clicked the button! 🍪')}>
    I'm a React Button Component 🙌
  </Button>
</p>

and the `<ResetStyle />` component in the `<Layout />` is providing a consistent style for all the pages with minimal effort

You can also mix `.js` and `.md` or `.mdx` files in your pages folder as needed
